You can use the obfuscated servers with Nord VPN to unblock internet

Set Up and Connect
1. Buy, Download and Install Nord VPN (I use nord because I have tested it but in theory some other stealth vpns could work too)
2. Open the app and login
3. Go to the settings
4. Go to auto-connect
5. Turn off "Choose a VPN protocol and server automatically" and Change the protocol to TCP
6. Go to advanced and turn on obfuscated servers
7. Go back to auto-connect and change "auto-connect to" to Obfuscated Servers
8. Exit settings and connect to obfuscated servers
