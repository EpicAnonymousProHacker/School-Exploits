Study the assesment very carefully to make sure there is not a specified file type or you will fail/get in trouble
Always make sure the file is covertable back to the original format or readable somehow
Make sure you have a reason to use that file type, e.g. my screen recorder saves the video as it

Anoying File Types:

Image:
- .pcx, Its uncompressed and has many compatability issues
- .raw, Unsupported in most places

Video:
- .rm, incompatability and bad compression

Text:
- No Extention, if they just add the file type extention back then it should work as normal

Audio:
- .aiff, uncompressed and unsupported


Note: Please contact me with any other file types
